        <h1>Books</h1>
        <p>Writing is a passion of mine, in fact I've written a few books.</p>

        <h2>Technical Works</h2>
        <p>I co-wrote an ice-cream-themed book series on Django with my wife, Audrey Roy Greenfeld. The most current version is for Django 1.11, the latest Long Term Support (LTS) version of the framework. That means this book is good until at least April of 2020!</p>

        </p>
        <p>Two Scoops of Django is chock-full of material that will help you with your Django projects. Written to support Django 1.11 LTS (Long Term Support), this book won't get outdated until 2020.</p>
