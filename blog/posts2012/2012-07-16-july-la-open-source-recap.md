title: July 15th, 2012 LA Open Source Recap
---

On July 15th, 2012, at the [July LA Hackathons Open Source
event](http://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/64542582/), over 60
[Python](http://python.org), [Django](http://djangoproject.com),
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/), [Ruby on
Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [PHP](http://www.php.net/),
[JavaScript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript),
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [Perl](http://www.perl.org/), and
[Clojure](http://clojure.org) developers arrived to work on a variety of
projects. We went from 10 AM to 10 PM, and there was much coding and
learning done by all. There was a very powerful vibe shared by nearly
everyone there, and it was great to see so many people from different
personal and open source backgrounds working together and having a great
time as a group.

Filtering out distractions
==========================

We made some changes to our proceedings for this event, entirely because
last time with 'distractions' that caused some issues. In a nutshell,
here is 50% of what we did:

1.  A clear statement in the event description and follow up emails that
    this event was for developers and designers only.
2.  Laptops were an absolute requirement for entry into the event.

We also rolled in a couple other tricks I'm not going to write down. If
you see me in person, ask away. The results were near perfect, and we
won't hesitate to use these techniques again.

Sponsors
========

We let attendees know which sponsors were interested in potential new
hires, in this case, [Originate](http://originatelabs.com) and
[Cars.com](http://cars.com). This sort of low-key technique helps us
land sponsors but doesn't annoy attendees. Speaking of sponsors, here
they are in alphabetical order:

-   [Cars.com](http://cars.com)
-   [Cartwheel Web](http://cartwheelweb.com)
-   [Heroku](http://heroku.com)
-   [Originate](http://originatelabs.com)

Code/Projects worked on
=======================

Next time I'm going to be a lot more careful about getting down the
details of what people did. Maybe a signup sheet or an online form?
Heck, sounds like a great quick project for next time!

-   [Django](http://djangoproject.com) (see below for details)
-   [Dynasaur](http://tglines.github.com/dynasaur/) (Node.js/DynamoDB
    ORM)
-   [Salt Stack](https://github.com/saltstack/salt)
-   [meteordraw](https://github.com/philfree/meteordraw)
-   [pyit](https://github.com/harph/pyit)
-   [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
-   [DBIx::Config](https://github.com/symkat/DBIx-Config)
-   Clojure Tutorials
-   [engulf](https://github.com/andrewvc/engulf) (Clojure load testing
    tool that got 2 more tests)
-   HTML5
-   PHP
-   Lots more!

Django Sprints
==============

My conservative estimate is that we had 12 people working on Django or
Django related projects. That's at least 20% of attendees.
Unfortunately, because I'm not a Django core developer, I wasn't
reviewing commits; so I am not entirely sure what was being worked on. I
do know that I wasn't the only person to commit to core Django.

As for me, I continued my efforts started at DjangoCon Europe to
refactor the
[Class](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/class-based-views/)
[Based](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/)
[Views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/class-based-views/mixins/)
documentation. I got in two pull requests and finally managed to badly
teach myself how to use git rebase.

**note**: I want to make it exceedingly clear that I'm not the only one
working the CBV doc refactor. I'm just one of the fold.

Socializing
===========

During meals we tried to keep people's hands off the keyboard.
Specifically everyone got a chance to state their name, toolset they
were working with, and something interesting/embarrassing about
themselves. Three of the more memorable ones:

-   An 8 year old attendee wrote his first 4 PHP programs!
-   [sym_kat](http://twitter.com/sym_kat) is invited to speak at the
    next London Perl Workshop.
-   Someone employed at SpaceX took Zed Shaw's
    [LPTHW](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) class taught by the man
    himself at [Cartwheel Web](http://cartwheelweb.com) HQ in 2011 got
    himself moved from the C# to the Python team. Go open source!

Closing thoughts
================

There were a few glitches, but nothing major. Most of those glitches
stem from us coming off two months of helping organize multiple events
while traveling literally around the world. I think things would have
been better if I had delegated more to the right people.

For the most part, there was this electrifying energy that had people
focused and working on what they wanted all day. Yet it wasn't all
heads-down-coding, their was some good coder-to-coder discussion and
fun. The result is at the end of the day people seemed refreshed and
empowered, wanting another day as soon as possible. We hope to be able
to catch this feeling at future events.

Which means we're plotting the next event now. If you are interested in
providing a venue or sponsoring the event, let me know at
<pydanny@cartwheelweb.com>.

**Update**: Corrected the details about the SpaceX guy.
