title: Join us at DjangoCon Europe!
---

This year in June, the European edition of
[DjangoCon](http://djangocon.eu) is going to be held in lovely
[Zurich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zurich),
[Switzerland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switzerland). It is my great
fortune and delight to announce that [Audrey](http://audreymroy.com) and
I will be attending. Hooray!

Needless to say, we're extremely excited. My [trip to Europe in
2007](http://dannygreenfeld.blogspot.com/search/label/ploneconf2007) was
an amazingly fun and educational experience, and I can't wait to share
a similar experience with Audrey. We can't wait to see all our old
European friends, make new ones, and be dazzled by what Europe has to
offer.

Also, let's face it, the conference is going to be **incredible**.
They've lined up some awesome venues, the food
([cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raclette), chocolate,
[muesli](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muesli), etc) in Switzerland is
world-renowned, the website looks fantastic, and they've got Jacob
Kaplan-Moss to keynote. It looks so good I'm surprised there are any
[sponsor slots left](http://2012.djangocon.eu/sponsors/)!

Talks
=====

While attending the conference, we submitted and hope to give a
presentation on the positives (speed, flexibility, community, etc) and
negatives (a few) of using [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) as a
[Django](http://djangoproject.com) datastore. I'm also considering
giving a second talk. Some ideas for that include:

-   Zen of Django
-   Django isn't for beginners (A Tredennick inspired talk explaining
    why teaching beginning developers Django isn't a good idea)
-   Advanced Django Template Usage
-   Advanced Django Models Usage (An intimidating talk to put together)
-   Django Packages Thunderdome II

Any thoughts?

While I'm at it, I'm going to poke any prospective conference goers to
submit their own talks. I love attending conference talks and at PyCon
US this year I barely got to see any. Show me what you got!
