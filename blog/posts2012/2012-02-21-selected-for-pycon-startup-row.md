title: Selected for PyCon StartUp Row
---

Me and Audrey have been working hard on [Consumer
Notebook](http://consumernotebook.com), a Python/Django based project.
We submitted it to PyCon StartUp row and found out this morning we've
been accepted. **Hooray!**

From the [PyCon StartUp Row winner's
post](http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/02/startup-row-winners-for-pycon-2012.html),
here is a little bit of what we're about:

> Have you tried researching products online recently? Search engines
> are gamed by scammy marketers. Product review sites overwhelm you with
> ads, have unreliable reviews, or dryly compare raw product specs.
> [Consumer Notebook](http://consumernotebook.com) is working to solve
> this problem. It is like Yelp for products, with product comparison
> grids inspired by the founders' open-source work on [Django
> Packages](http://djangopackages.com) and [Open
> Comparison](http://opencomparison.org).

Just so you know, [PyCon](http://us.pycon.org) in North America is the
biggest gathering for the international Python community. The conference
this year is in Santa Clara, California, and is sold-out at 1500+
attendees, but could have easily sold out several times that number. The
talks, tutorials, and events are going to be incredible, and I'm
delighted to be part of the PyCon experience!

We look forward to sharing the StartUp Row with friends like Transifex,
Python Packages, and [Wedding Lovely](http://www.weddinglovely.com/).

Please check out [Consumer Notebook](http://consumernotebook.com) right
now and also visit our PyCon booth on Saturday, March 10th and we'll
show you what we're doing.
